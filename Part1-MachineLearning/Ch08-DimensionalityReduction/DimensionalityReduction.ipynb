    "# Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning problems often have a large number of features involved. FOr larger problems this could be in thousands or even millions of features. Having such a arge number of features not only makes training on the data very slow but it could also make it harder for the model to find a good solution. We will prove this later. This problem is referred to as the *curse of dimensionality*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real world problems however it is possible to reduce the number of features. For example if we are working with the MNIST dataset (dataset of images of handwritten numbers), the data is in 0 and 1s. The black part of the image which is the the actual number and the white part of the image which is the background. Obviously the background is irrelevant and so we can remove all the features whose value is 1. Also there is a strong correlation between neighboring pixels in data. So we can reduce the number of features by finding the mean of the 2 neighboring pixels and mege them into a single pixel. You will also not lose too much information.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to remember that reducing dimensionality does lead to some amount of information loss. We can intuitevely guess this, also we have seen it happen when we try to compress an image into the JPEG format and it loses some quality. This will speed up training but it could also lead to your model performing slightly worse. It also makes your pipelines more complex and hence harder to maintain. If training is too slow, you should firsst try to train the system using original data before you consider using dimensionality reduction. In some scrnarios reducing dimensionality of the training fata may remove noise and unnecessary details and could result in better performance this however will not happen generally, in most cases it will only speed up training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from speeeding up training, dimensionality reduction can be extremely useful for data visualisation. Reducing the number of dimensions down to two (or three) makes it possible to plot a condensed view of high dimensionality training data which could be useful for us to find some important insights by visually detecting patterns such as clusters. Data visualisation is also very important in order to communicate your conclusions to people who are not data scientist, such as decision makers who will use your results.\n",

    "## 1. Curse of Dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "We are very used to living in three dimensions, which is why we cannot intuitively understand a higher dimensional space. For example we find it very difficult to picture even a basic 4D hypercube, let alone a 200 dimensional ellipsoid bent in a 1000 dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Things behave very differently when we are working in a high dimensional space. For example, if you pick a random point in a unit square, there is a about a 0.4% chance that it will be located less than 0.001 from a border (in other words it is very unlikely that the random point will be extreme along any dimension), however in a 10000 dimensional hypercube, this probability is greater than 99.999999%. Most points in a high dimensional space are very close to the border of the hypercube. (For a real world example: anyone you know is probably an extremist in at leat one dimension, for example how much sugar they put in their coffee, if you consider enough dimensions).\n",
    "\n",
    "An even bigger difference, is that if you pick two points randomly in a unit square, the distance between these two points will on average be roughly 0.52. If you pick two random points in a unit 3D cube, the average distance will be roughly 0.66. If you picked two points randomly in a 1,000,000-dimensional hypercube, the average distance will be about 408.25 roughly $\\sqrt{1,000,000/6}$. This is counterintiuitve, as how can two points be so far apart when they both lie in the same unit hypercube. The reason is that there is plently of space in high dimensions. As a result high-dimensional datasets are at risk of being very sparse, most training instances are likely to be far away from each other. This alsp means that a new instance will be far away from any training instance, making predictions much less reliable in lower dimensions since they will be based on large extrapolations. In short the more dimensions the training set has, the greater the risk of overfitting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory one solution to this problem is to increase the size of the training set to reach a sufficient density of training instances. However in practice the number of training instances required to reach a given density grows exponentially with the number of dimensions. FOr example with just 100 features (significantally lesse than in the MNIST problem), you would need more training instances than atoms in the observable universe in order for training instances to be within 0.1 of each other on average, assuming they were all spread out uniformly across all dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Main Approaches for Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Before discussing specific dimensionality reduction algorithms, we will look into the two main approaches to reducing dimensionality: Projection and Manifold Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Projection\n",
    "\n",
    "In most real world scenarios data is not uniformally spread across all dimensions. This is because many of the features are constant and many of them are highly correlated. As a result most instances lie within or close to a much lower dimensional subspace of the high demensional space. To get an idea we will look at the following example.\n",
    "\n",

    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Akramz/Hands-on-Machine-Learning-with-Scikit-Learn-Keras-and-TensorFlow/63b8d7a91ff1ca2fdc35947a6a390c5a81085bd2//static/imgs/subspace_projection.png\" height=\"300\">\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we can notice that all the training instances lie close to a plane. This is a lower dimensional (2D) subspace of the high dimensional (3D) space. Now if we project all the training instances onto this subspace, we will get a 2D dataset (represented by the solid lines) which looks like the following. Notice that the axes correspond to new features $z_1$ and $z_2$ (the coordinates of the projections on the plane).\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Akramz/Hands-on-Machine-Learning-with-Scikit-Learn-Keras-and-TensorFlow/63b8d7a91ff1ca2fdc35947a6a390c5a81085bd2//static/imgs/2d_projection.png\" height=\"300\">\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "However projection is not always the best approach to dimensionality reduction. This is because sometimes the subspace may twist and turn which is seen in the very popular swiss roll toy dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*GIUnQnlgfSe3vZMoRkg1ww.png\" height=\"400\">\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply projecting onto a plane, would squash different layers of the Swiss Roll together, as shown on the left side. However if we unroll the Swiss Roll along the axis of the plane, we get the 2D dataset on the right. This unrolling preserves the local structure of the Swiss Roll, but it distorts the global structure. This is why it is generally preferable to choose the axis to unroll along, rather than just projecting onto a plane.\n",

    "</center>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Manifold Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The Swiss Roll dataset, that we have saw earlier is an example of a 2D manifold. A 2D manifold is a 2D shape that can be bent or twisted in a higher dimensional space. Generally a d-dimensional manifold is part of an n dimensional space where $d < n$ that locally resembles a d-dimensional hyperplane. In the case of a swiss roll, $d = 2, n = 3$, it locally resembles a 2D place but it is rolled in the third dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hyperplane is a subspace whose dimensionality is 1 less than the ambient space around it. For example the hyperplane for a 3D space is a 2D plane while the hyperplane for a 2D space is a 1D space like a line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many dimensionality reduction algorithms work by modelling the manifold on which the training instances lie. This is called Manifold Learning. It relies on the maniforld assumptio which is also called the maniforld hypothesis: states that most real-world high dimensional datasets lie close to a much lower dimensional manifold. This assumption is very often emperically observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The manifold assumption is very often accompanied by another illicit assumption: that the task at hand (classification or regression for example) will be simpler if expressed in the lower dimensional space of the manifold. For example in the image given below where we try to classify the points, after we have unrolled the swiss roll the deicision boundary is a lot simpler. This is seen in the top row.\n",
    "\n",
    "This however does not always hold true, for example in the bottom row, the decision boundary for the higher dimensional space is at $x_1 = 5$. This decisiom boundary is very simple in the 3D space but it is more complex in the 2D unrolled manifold where it is made up of a collection of four independent line segments.\n",

    "## 3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is by far the most popular dimensionality reduction algorithm. First it identifies the hyperplane that lies closest to the data, and then it projects the data onto it. The following figure shows the result of applying PCA to the 3D Swiss Roll dataset. The projection (represented by the dashed lines) preserves the distances between the instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will be divided into the following subsections: -\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Preserving the Variance\n",
    "2. Principal Components\n",
    "3. Projecting Down to d Dimensions\n",
    "4. Using Scikit-Learn\n",
    "5. Explained Variance Ratio\n",
    "6. Choosing the Right Number of Dimensions\n",
    "7. PCA for Compression\n",
    "8. Randomized PCA\n",
    "9. Incremental PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Preserving the Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you project the training set onto a lower dimensional hyperplane, you first need to choose the right hyperplane. In the example simple 2D dataset given below, there are three different axes (1D hyperplanes). On the right is the result of the projection of the dataset onto each of the axes. As seen the projection onto the solid line preserves the maximum variance, while the projection onto the dotted line preserves the minimum variance. The dashed line preserves an intermediate amount of variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*qKESl4pUx0p6vqrv\" height=\"300\">\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems reasonable to select the axis that preserved the maximum amount of variance, as it will likly lose the least amount of information as compared to the other projections. Another way to justify this choice is that it is the axis that minimises the mean squared distance between the original dataset and its projection onto that axis. This is the idea behind PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Principal Components\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA identifies the axis that acounts for the largest amount of variance in the training set. It is the solid line. It also finds a second axis orthogonal to the first one that accounts for the largest amount of remaining variance. For our above example this is the solid and dotted line. Solid line is chosen first we then need to find axis orthogonal to it so that is the dotted line only as the dashed line is not orthogonal. if it were a higher dimensional dataset, PCA would find a third axis, orthogonal to the previous two axes and a fourth, fifth and so on - as many axes ars the number of dimensions in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $i^{th}$ axis is called the $i^{th}$ principal component (PC). The first PC is the axis on which vector $c_1$ lies and the second PC is the axis on which the vector $c_2$ lies. THe first two PCs are the orthogonal axes on which the two arrows lie, on the plane, and the third PC is the axis orthogonal to that plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each principal componnet, PCA find a zero-centered unit vector pointing in the direction of the PC. Since two opposing unit vectors lie on the same axis, the direction of the unit vectors returned bu PCA is not stable: if you perturb the training set slightly and run PCA again, the unit vectors may point in the opposite direction as the original vectors. However, they will generally lie on the same axes. In some cases, a pair of unit vectors may even rotate or swap (if the variances along the axes are close), but the plane they define will generally remain the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the question of how to find the prinicpal components of a training set arises. There is a standard matrix factorization technique called Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) that can decompose the training set matrix $X$ into the matrix multiplication of three matrices $U \\Sigma V^T$ where $V$ contains the unit vectors that efine all the principal components that we are looking for, as shown in the following equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation: Principal Components Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "$V = \\begin{bmatrix} c_1 & c_2 & \\dots & c_n \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following python code uses NumPys svd() function to obtain all the principal components of the training set, then extracts the two unit vectors that define the first two PCs."
